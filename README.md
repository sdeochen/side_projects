Hosting some just-for-fun projects.

1. **The Gospel Coalition Project.** *Summer 2022.* I wanted to know what percentage of TGC authors were women, and how their bio's and self-descriptions might differ from male authors' bios. I also wanted to learn how to scrape web-pages using R. There was no API available from TGC for easy data scraping so I built my own scraper to grab author bios, names, and also titles of their work. 
2. **r/osu vs. r/uofm Reddit.** *Fall 2022* Quick scrape of Ohio State and University of Michigan subreddit titles to look for most frequent terms. OSU had more sports related titles, UM posters had squirrel and comptuer science/coursework related titles.
