This simulation cheat sheet is to help researchers approximate what sort of sample size they might need to estimate a population's NPS with good accuracy.

### Sample Size Needed for 5 and 7% Margin of Error 

The table approximates the sample size you need to get within 5 points of the true NPS 95% of the time you take a sample. I also plotted the sample size needed to get within 7 points of the true NPS, 95% of the time.

Based on the results, the sample you need depends on what the true NPS is. You can use prior experience/research and some critical thinking to guess at what that NPS might be.

Ballparked suggested sample sizes based on NPS:

```{r}
table_to_use <- data.frame(`NPS score` = c(0,
                                           20,
                                           40,
                                           50,
                                           60,
                                           65,

                                           80,
                                           85),
                           `Sample size 5pct MOE` = c(1250,

### Margin of Error Simulation Results

The plots below show the results.  

Notes on how to read the plots:  

* The black line shows the true NPS of that population  
* The purple line shows the NPS score 5 points above the true NPS  
* The red line shows the NPS score 7 points above the true NPS  
* Where the shaded area and line intersect shows us what sample size we need to hit +/- 5 points (or +/- 7 points) from the true value 95% of the time.

### Simulation code

Step 1: Create the hypothetical "populations" that we will sample from and compute sample NPS. I will vary the NPS score of the population itself. NPS can be varied by changing the % promoters, % detractors, or both. I won't simulate every potential population but will test some groups based on how we typically see NPS distributed for our main surveys.

```{r create populations and specify parameters, echo = T, eval = F}

#set population to 50k. Can re-do simulation with different sizes if needed.
pop_size <- 50000

#set number of iterations you want for your simulations
times <- 1000

#sample sizes to test
sample_sizes <- c(50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000)

#for population NPS of 85, I'll make 90% promoters, 5% passive, and 5% detractors

p85 <- c(rep("Promoter", .9 * pop_size), 
         rep("Passive", .05 * pop_size),
         rep("Detractor", .05 * pop_size))

p80 <- c(rep("Promoter", .87 * pop_size), 
         rep("Passive", .06 * pop_size),
         rep("Detractor", .07 * pop_size))

p75 <- c(rep("Promoter", .82 * pop_size), 
         rep("Passive", .11 * pop_size),
         rep("Detractor", .07 * pop_size))

p70 <- c(rep("Promoter", .79 * pop_size), 
         rep("Passive", .12 * pop_size),
         rep("Detractor", .09 * pop_size))

p65 <- c(rep("Promoter", .75 * pop_size), 
         rep("Passive", .15 * pop_size),
         rep("Detractor", .1 * pop_size))

p60 <- c(rep("Promoter", .72 * pop_size), 
         rep("Passive", .16 * pop_size),
         rep("Detractor", .12 * pop_size))

p45 <- c(rep("Promoter", .65 * pop_size), 
         rep("Passive", .15 * pop_size),
         rep("Detractor", .20 * pop_size))
p40 <- c(rep("Promoter", .62 * pop_size), 
         rep("Passive", .16 * pop_size),
         rep("Detractor", .22 * pop_size))

p20 <- c(rep("Promoter", .50 * pop_size), 
         rep("Passive", .20 * pop_size),
         rep("Detractor", .30 * pop_size))


p0 <- c(rep("Promoter", .35 * pop_size), 
         rep("Passive", .30 * pop_size),
         rep("Detractor", .35 * pop_size))


#these options are for testing same NPS scores but different distributions
p40_b <- c(rep("Promoter", .70 * pop_size), 
         rep("Passive", 0 * pop_size),
         rep("Detractor", .30 * pop_size))


p0_b <- c(rep("Promoter", .1 * pop_size), 
         rep("Passive", .8 * pop_size),
         rep("Detractor", .1 * pop_size))
```

Then I wrote some functions to do sampling and computing NPS, and getting the 95% intervals.

```{r functions, echo = T, eval = F}


nps <- function(x) {
  step1 <- length(x[x == "Promoter"])/length(x) * 100
  step2 <- length(x[x == "Detractor"])/length(x) * 100
  return(step1 - step2)
}

samp <- function(data_set, sample_size){
  output <- sample(data_set, sample_size, replace = F)
  return(output)
}

sample_function <- function(data_set, sample_size, num_iterations) {
  
  output <- replicate(num_iterations, samp(data_set, sample_size))
  output <- data.frame(
    output
  )
  
  return(output)
}
  
test_matrix <- sample_function(p45, 5, 10)

test_output <- apply(
    sample_function(p40, 10, 5), 
    MARGIN = 2, 
    FUN = nps)


#get median nps for all the samples you took, as well as the 95% confidence interval, which would be the NPS value at position .025 and .975
all_nps <- function(data_set, sample_size, num_iterations) {
  output <- apply(
    sample_function(data_set, sample_size, num_iterations), 
    MARGIN = 2, 
    FUN = nps) %>%
    sort()

    lower_position <- round(.025 * length(output), 0)
    upper_position <- round(.975 * length(output), 0)
  
    results <- data.frame(median_nps = round(median(output), 1),
                          lower_bound = round(output[lower_position], 1),
                          upper_bound = round(output[upper_position], 1)) %>%
      mutate(range = upper_bound - lower_bound)
  
  return(results)
}  


```


Code for producing the results and the plots. I ran the simulations, saved the image, and knit the final file just reading in the image.

```{r fig.height = 10, fig.width = 13, eval = F, echo = T}



plotres <- function(x, true_nps) {
  output <- ggplot(x, aes(sample_size, upper_bound)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_bound, ymax = upper_bound,
                  fill = "purple",
                alpha = .1)) +
  geom_line(aes(sample_size, true_nps + 7), #7% margin of error
            color = rktcol[1],
            alpha = .8) +
    geom_line(aes(sample_size, true_nps + 5), #5% margin of error
            color = rktcol[2],
            alpha = .8) +
  geom_line(aes(sample_size, true_nps), #true population NPS
            color = 'black') +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14) +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rktcol[6]) 
    
  
  return(output)
}
  
#plots for each simulation results

make_the_plot <- function(data_set, true_nps) {
  sim_results <- data.frame(sample_size = sample_sizes,
                          median_nps = NA,
                          lower_bound = NA,
                          upper_bound = NA,
                          range = NA)
  
  for(i in 1:length(sample_sizes))
  sim_results[i, c(2:5)] <- all_nps(data_set, sample_sizes[i], times)
  
  output <- plotres(sim_results, true_nps)
  
  return(output)
}

### Check different distributions for MOE

The same NPS score can be produced by 2 different populations (for example, an NPS of 40 can result from 65% promoters - 25% detractors, *or* 45% promoters and 5% detractors). I ran my simulation keeping detractors and passives fairly balanced, since that is what I have observed with our typical NPS data. But do the required sample sizes for 5 and 7% margins of error change when the distribution producing the same NPS changes?

Let's estimate the sample size needed for NPS = 40 (70% promoters, 30% detractors, 0 passives), and compare that to the original simulation of NPS = 40 (62% promoters, 22% detractors, 16% passive).


Let's also estimate for an NPS = 0 (10% promoters, 10% detractors, 80% passives), compared to the original simulation of NPS = 0 (35% promoters, 35% detractors, 30% passive).

It may be that as you get closer to NPS = 0, the more passives you have (relative to the full distribution), the lower your sample size needs to be.

So there are 2 opposing forces at play for determining NPS sample size. 

**One is NPS itself**.   
The closer to 100 (or -100), the smaller your sample size needs to be to get 5% margin of error. Conversely, the closer NPS is to 0, the larger your sample size needs to be to achieve 5% margin of error 95% of the time.

This makes sense: after you account for promoters, the remaining % of respondents logically have to split between detractors and passives. The closer NPS is to 100, logically the fewer remaining respondents you have to allocate to these other 2 groups. The extremes (both 100 and -100) constrict how many other types of respondents you can have. 

**The other is share of passives (maybe).**  
As you get closer to 0, you can in theory have more room to alter how you split the remaining respondents (detractors vs passives). If you have a lower share of passives, the higher your sample size needs to be. If passives are more evenly split with detractors, then your sample size can be smaller. (That's a hypothesis - I should simulate this more to test it.)
